# Vercel Deployment Plan

## 1. Pre-deployment Verification
- **Vercel Config**: `vercel.json` is correctly set up for rewriting `/api/*` requests to the serverless function.
- **API Entry Point**: `api/index.ts` correctly exports the Express app handler.
- **Dependencies**: The project relies on `server` files which are outside the `src` directory.

## 2. Configuration Fixes
- **Update `tsconfig.json`**:
  - Currently, `tsconfig.json` only includes `"src"` and `"api"`.
  - **Action**: Add `"server"` to the `include` array. This ensures TypeScript correctly compiles the backend logic during the Vercel build process.

## 3. Deployment Instruction
- Since I cannot directly run `vercel deploy` (requires authentication/login flow), I will prepare the codebase for you to deploy.
- **User Action**: You will simply need to push these changes to your Git repository (which is linked to Vercel) or run `vercel --prod` in your terminal if you have the CLI installed.

## 4. Execution Steps
1.  Modify `tsconfig.json`.
2.  (Optional) Verify build locally to ensure no TS errors.
3.  Notify user that the project is ready for deployment.
