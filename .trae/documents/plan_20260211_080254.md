# GitHub Deployment Plan

## 1. Configure Remote Repository
- **Action**: Add the remote origin pointing to `https://github.com/rippleshe/NeteaseDL.git`.
- **Command**: `git remote add origin https://github.com/rippleshe/NeteaseDL.git` (or `set-url` if it exists).

## 2. Commit & Push Code
- **Action**: Stage all changes, create a commit, and push to the `main` branch.
- **Commands**:
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "feat: complete music restore project with netease optimization"`
  - `git branch -M main`
  - `git push -u origin main`

## 3. Vercel Deployment (via Git)
- Once the code is on GitHub, you can link it in Vercel.
- **Action**: Since I cannot access your Vercel dashboard, I will guide you to:
  1.  Go to Vercel Dashboard -> "New Project".
  2.  Select "Import Git Repository".
  3.  Choose `rippleshe/NeteaseDL`.
  4.  Vercel will auto-detect settings and deploy.

## 4. Immediate Execution
I will perform the Git operations now. If `git push` requires authentication (which it likely will), I will prompt you to run the push command yourself or use the Vercel CLI fallback.

Let's start by configuring the remote and committing.
